# Optimizing-Exam-Schedules
 THWS (FIW) - Computer Science &amp; Business Informatics

Problem Statement : To automate the examination schedule for the University of Applied Sciences WÃ¼rzburg-Schweinfurt department (FIW) - Computer Science &amp; Business Informatics

There are 3 approaches used to solve the problem here:

1. Reinforcement learning simulated annealing hyper-heuristic framework - does not converge and can be executed via the file main_RL_HH_SA

2. Reinforcement Learning PPO framework does not converges and can be executed via the file main_RL_PPO.ipynb
   Although its initial solution converges and can be executed over the folder CPSchedule

3. Genetic Algorithm - converges and can be executed from the folder GeneticSchedule

The Poster, Paper and Presentation Slides for the demo are attached herewith.
